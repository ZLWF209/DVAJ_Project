## Introduction

You Smoke, You Choke, Is a website to help raise awareness to ages from 16-24 about the harms of smoking! When you quit smoking, good things start to happen — you can begin to see almost immediate improvements to your health.
It is never too late to quit, and it's time to eliminate smoking, giving everyone the greatest opportunity to reduce health inequalities. This website is only one page inspired by tik-toks as you can only scroll down and we chose a
pink and bold colors to appeal to the target audiance. The aim of this project is to promote the idea of saving money from not starting a smoking addiction and to show the consuquences of your health when you begin smoking.

Each data set we have presented, you can hover your mouse to see details of the data. Both yoinks and jeepers card flips if you hover over it to show some smoking facts. The slideer also provides a accruate insight on how much money can be saved.
